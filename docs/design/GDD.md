### Vision

Make automation feel tactile, and programming feel empowering instead of academic. Players should gradually evolve from manual operator to systems engineer controlling a bot swarm.

### Pillars

1. Automation is physical and readable
2. Robots are agents, not static machines
3. Programming is approachable and debuggable
4. Constraints create interesting decisions (power, bandwidth, CPU, space)

### Player verbs

Move, craft, place, route, buffer, program, debug, optimize, expand.

### Progression

* Manual tools → dumb machines → basic bots → smart bots → coordinated swarm
* Unlock via CPU Cores, power tech, sensors, better chassis

### Failure modes

* Belt jams and starvation
* Power brownouts
* Robots stuck, task deadlocks
* Bad code and race conditions (fun, not punishing)

### Content (early)

Resources:

* Ore, Copper, Silicon, Carbon, Alloy, Crystal
  Machines:
* Miner (manual/robot), Smelter, Assembler, Charger
  Items:
* Plates, Wires, Circuits, Gears, Battery Cells, CPU Core
